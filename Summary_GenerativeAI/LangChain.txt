(1) Langchain is a framework which uses LLMs. ChatGpt is an application which is made using LLMs. LLMs is a machine learning model
    which is trained on huge text corpus whose architecture is based on transformers.

(2) We will create LangChain Application using repl. Go to: https://replit.com/ and then make account and create Python Repl with templates.

(3) write in code editor:

import openai
import langchain

-- all dependencies will automatically installed

(4) To use the OpenAI models, we have to go to openai website, make account and create the secret key from your profile.

(5) Come to Repl, go to tools, go to secrets and paste the secret key with OPENAI_API_KEY name

(6) Temperature is a parameter in openai function which is used for randomness. It has value between 0 and 1.
    If it has value near 1 then it gives more random result and if it has value towards 0 then it gives repeated values.
